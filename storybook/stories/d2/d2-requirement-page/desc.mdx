# Requirement



The Requirement model represents a generic class for any type of prerequisite that may be desired, needed, or imposed as an obligation. <br/> It has three subtypes: Criterion, InformationRequirement, and Constraint. <br/>



Criterion is a Requirement that defines a list of Requirements. This type of Requirement is used to create a set of criteria that must be met in order for a given system to satisfy its objectives. <br/>



InformationRequirement represents the need to obtain a necessary piece of information, without any condition that depends on the actual content of this information. This type of Requirement is used to specify the information that must be available to a system but needs human intervention in order to be validated (e.g. a pdf document), or that is used as-is to deduce other pieces of information. <br/>



Constraint defines a clear and concrete constraint over a specific piece of information. This type of Requirement is used to specify conditions that must be met in order for a given system to satisfy its objectives, such as restrictions on the values of certain parameters or fields. <br/>
