Feature: CertificationRemoveEvidence

  Scenario: I want to remove evidence from a request
    Given An evidence type is created:
      | identifier |
      | et1        |
    And A certification is created
    And Some evidences are added to the certifications:
      | evidence | name             | isConformantTo |
      | e1       | proof            | et1            |
      | e2       | proof_but_better | et1            |
    When I remove an evidence from the certification:
      | evidence |
      | e1       |
    Then The certification should not contain the evidence:
      | evidence |
      | e1       |
    And The certification should contain the evidence:
      | evidence |
      | e2       |
