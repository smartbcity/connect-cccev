Feature: CertificationRemoveRequirements

  Scenario: I want to remove requirements from a certification
    Given Some requirements are created:
      | identifier |
      | r1         |
      | r2         |
      | r3          |
    And A certification is created:
      | requirements |
      | r1, r2, r3   |
    When I remove requirements from the certification:
      | requirements |
      | r1, r2       |
    Then The certification should not contain the requirements:
      | requirements |
      | r1, r2       |
    And The certification should contain the requirements:
      | requirements |
      | r3           |
